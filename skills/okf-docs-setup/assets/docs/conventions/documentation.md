# Documentation lifecycle policy

This bundle conforms to the Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.1 — see
[/references/okf.md](/references/okf.md). This concept is the single source of truth for
the docs flow; CLAUDE.md and the `.claude` rules link here rather than restating it.

## The bundle

- One bundle rooted at `docs/`. `docs/superpowers/**` is **excluded** (it holds design
  specs and plans — process meta, not knowledge concepts).
- Repo-wide knowledge lives at the top level (`conventions/`, `glossary/`, `references/`);
  subsystem knowledge nests under the subsystem (`<subsystem>/<area>/...`).
- A concept = one markdown file = YAML frontmatter + markdown body. Concept ID = the
  file path within the bundle minus `.md` (identity is positional, not a field).

## Frontmatter standard

Every concept (everything except `index.md` / `log.md`) opens with:

```yaml
---
type: <one of the taxonomy values> # REQUIRED — non-empty
title: <human-readable name> # recommended
description: <one-sentence summary> # recommended
timestamp: <ISO 8601> # recommended — last meaningful change
tags: [<tag>, ...] # optional
# extension keys allowed, e.g. for retiring a concept:
status: superseded
superseded_by: /path/to/replacement.md
---
```

- Only `type` is hard-required (OKF §9). `title`, `description`, `timestamp` are
  recommended — `pnpm docs:validate` warns (never fails) when they are missing.
- `status` / `superseded_by` are our extension keys for the deprecation flow; OKF
  requires consumers to tolerate unknown keys, so they are spec-safe.

## The taxonomy (open — five concept types + the Subsystem role)

| `type`          | Purpose                                                              | Conventional body                                                         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Decision`      | A durable architectural decision: choice, alternatives, consequences | Context · Decision · Alternatives · Consequences · `# Amendments` (dated) |
| `Specification` | How something works: mechanics, algorithms, API shapes, formulas     | structural markdown; cite the governing `Decision`                        |
| `Convention`    | Prescriptive coding/design rules                                     | rule statements + rationale                                               |
| `Glossary`      | One defined term per file                                            | definition + links to where it is used                                    |
| `Reference`     | External material mirrored as a first-class concept                  | summary + `# Citations`                                                   |

The taxonomy is **open** — add a type later by just using it (e.g. `Guide`, `Runbook`).
Consumers must tolerate unknown types.

**Subsystem orientation** is provided by a directory's reserved `index.md` (no
frontmatter), not by a `type`. There is no `type: Subsystem` frontmatter value.

## Reserved files

- **`index.md`** (any directory): no frontmatter, except the bundle-root `docs/index.md`
  which carries only `okf_version: "0.1"`. Body = `#` section headings, each a bullet
  list of `[Title](/absolute/path.md) - description`. Used for progressive disclosure.
- **`log.md`** (any level): `## YYYY-MM-DD` headings, newest first; bulleted prose
  entries with a conventional leading bold verb (`**Creation**`, `**Update**`,
  `**Deprecation**`).

## Linking

- Cross-references are plain markdown links, bundle-relative absolute
  (`/<subsystem>/<area>/specs/<concept>.md`).
- Relationship meaning lives in prose, not in metadata (OKF has no typed relations).
- Broken links are tolerated (they may be not-yet-written knowledge); the validator
  reports them as warnings, never errors.

## Code in concepts — separate truth by type

Two kinds of truth live in this repo, and each has exactly one home:

- **Executable truth** — code, tests, schemas, workflow YAML, generated API reference.
  It is verified by running it; its single source is the file that runs. This is
  everything in the repo **outside `docs/`**.
- **Explanatory truth** — ADRs/`Decision`s, glossary, business rules, runbooks,
  architecture context, ownership, cross-system knowledge. It is verified by review and
  shared understanding; its single source is the `docs/` bundle.

The bundle holds explanatory truth and **points at** executable truth — it never copies
it. So:

- **Do not paste executable truth verbatim.** Reference it — name the file and symbol, or
  link it (`see \`src/foo/Bar.ts\` → \`baz()\``). Copied code, schemas, or YAML drift the
  moment the source changes and the validator cannot catch the divergence.
- **Illustrative code is fine when it is not a copy:** short pseudo-code, a formula, an
  API/type _shape_, or a minimal example written for the doc. Keep it to the smallest
  fragment that makes the point, and prefer prose + a citation over a fragment when either
  works.
- A `Specification` describes behaviour and contracts; if you find yourself reproducing an
  implementation, link to it and describe what it guarantees instead.

This is the docs-bundle expression of DRY — explanatory truth here in `docs/`, executable
truth everywhere outside it.

## Create / Update / Supersede

- **Create** a concept when: a new subsystem appears (a subsystem `index.md` + initial
  concepts); an architecturally significant choice is made (`Decision`); a non-obvious
  behaviour/algorithm/API ships (`Specification`); a repo-wide rule is adopted
  (`Convention`); a new domain term enters use (`Glossary`); external material needs to
  be first-class (`Reference`). Use the **`docs-add`** skill.
- **Update** a concept when: source behaviour changes → revise the matching
  `Specification` and bump `timestamp`; a decision is revised or reversed → **amend** the
  `Decision` (append a dated entry under `# Amendments`, do **not** rewrite history) and
  add a `log.md` line.
- **Supersede** when knowledge stops being true: set `status: superseded` +
  `superseded_by:` linking the replacement; add a `log.md` `**Deprecation**` entry.
  Never silently delete.

## The update ceremony

The mechanical bookkeeping of any `docs/**` edit — bump `timestamp`, append a `log.md`
entry, amend-don't-rewrite `Decision`s, set supersede keys — is surfaced automatically by
the always-on `docs-authoring` rule (it fires on every `docs/**` edit). `pnpm docs:validate`
is the backstop (advisory; it never blocks).
